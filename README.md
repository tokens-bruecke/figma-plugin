## ⚙️ How to run

In the project directory, you can run:
- `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` to run the app in the development mode.
- `yarn build` or `npm run build` to build the app for production to the `build` folder.

---

## ❗ Important

- run `yarn build` or `npm run build` before publishing the plugin to Figma. This will optimize the code and remove unnecessary files.
- You'll need to restart plugin in Figma in order to see the changes during development.
- Do not forget to replace the name and id of the plugin in the `manifest.json` file before publication.
